/**
 * {@code BombExplodeEvent} is fired whenever a {@link Bomb} explosion occurs.
 * <p>
 * This event is {@link Cancellable} and is designed to allow multiple plugins to
 * collaboratively determine which blocks should be affected by the explosion.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Event Workflow</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The event is constructed with the {@link #originalBlocks} list containing
 *       <b>all</b> blocks that would be affected by the explosion.</li>
 *   <li>When the event is fired, {@link #approved} starts empty — no blocks are initially approved.</li>
 *   <li>Each listener inspects {@link #getOriginalBlocks()} and uses {@link #addAffectedBlocks(Collection)}
 *       to approve blocks for removal. Approved blocks from all listeners are <b>merged</b> into a single set.</li>
 *   <li>After all listeners have run, {@link #getAffectedBlocks()} contains the
 *       <b>union</b> of blocks approved by all listeners.</li>
 *   <li>The plugin firing this event should use {@link #getAffectedBlocks()} to
 *       perform the actual block modifications (e.g., setting them to air).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>This approach prevents listeners from overwriting each other's decisions,
 * avoiding the common "last listener wins" problem with lists.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Listener Guidelines</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Use {@link #getOriginalBlocks()} to examine the full set of possible blocks.</li>
 *   <li>Call {@link #addAffectedBlocks(Collection)} to approve blocks your plugin owns.</li>
 *   <li>Avoid calling {@link #setAffectedBlocks(List)} unless you explicitly intend to
 *       replace all previously approved blocks.</li>
 *   <li>Check {@link #isCancelled()} before doing heavy processing if you want to
 *       ignore cancelled explosions.</li>
 * </ul>
